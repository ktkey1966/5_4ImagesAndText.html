<h1>Mystery Tulip Murderer Strikes</h1>
<p style="clear: left;">
    Someone, or something, is killing the tulips of New South
    Haverford, Virginia. Residents of this small town are
    shocked and dismayed by the senseless vadalism that has
    struck their tiny town.
</p>
<p>
    New South Haverford is known for its extravagant displays 
    of tulips in the springtime, and a good portion of its 
    tourist trade relies on the people who come from as far as 
    New Hampshire to see what has been estimated as up to two 
    hundred thousand tulips that bloom in April and May.

<p>
    Or at least the tourists had been flocking to New South 
    Haverford until last week, when over the course of three
    days the flower of each and every tulip in the town was 
    neatly clipped off while the town slept.

    "It started at the south end of town," said Augustin Frouf,
    a retired ladder-maker who has personally planted over five 
    hundred pink lily-flowered tulips. "They hit the houses up 
    on Elm Street, and moved down into town from there. After 
    the second night, we tried keeping guard. We tried bright 
    lights, dogs, everything. There was always something that 
    pulled us away, and by the time we got back, they were all
    gone."
